# **Project: Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS)**  

## **Context**  
A company wants to develop a Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) that allows homeowners to monitor, control, and optimize energy consumption. The system will manage smart devices such as lights, thermostats, solar panels, and electric vehicle chargers. The goal is to reduce energy bills while maintaining comfort and sustainability.

## **Project Goals**  
- **Energy Monitoring**: Real-time energy consumption and production tracking.  
- **Device Control**: Remote control of smart devices through a mobile and web app.  
- **Automation**: Automated schedules and AI-based energy optimization.  
- **Energy Insights**: Usage history, consumption predictions, and savings reports.  
- **Grid Integration**: Sell surplus solar energy back to the grid.  

---

## **Functional Requirements**  
- User authentication and account management.  
- Device registration and configuration.  
- Real-time energy consumption monitoring.  
- Device control (on/off, scheduling).  
- Energy usage reports and statistics.  
- Notifications for energy-saving tips and alerts.  

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**  
- **Scalability**: Must support millions of connected devices.  
- **Low Latency**: Device control actions must execute within 1 second.  
- **High Availability**: 99.95% uptime.  
- **Data Security**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data.  
- **Compliance**: GDPR and energy regulation compliance.

## **Suggested Architecture**  

### **Frontend**  
- **Web App**: React.js / Next.js  
- **Mobile App**: React Native  

### **Backend**  
- **API Layer**: Node.js with TypeScript (REST or GraphQL).  
- **Microservices**: Independent services for device management, data processing, and notifications.  

### **Data Storage**  
- **Timeseries Data**: InfluxDB for energy data.  
- **Relational Data**: PostgreSQL for user and device management.  
- **Cache**: Redis for fast data retrieval.  

### **IoT Communication**  
- **Protocol**: MQTT for real-time device communication.  

### **Messaging Queue**  
- Kafka / RabbitMQ for event-driven processing.  

### **Cloud & Deployment**  
- Kubernetes for orchestration.  
- Docker containers.  
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions.  

### **Monitoring & Logging**  
- Prometheus + Grafana for performance monitoring.  
- ELK Stack for centralized logging.

## **Next Steps**  
1. **Define Core Use Case**: Device registration and energy tracking.  
2. **Architectural Design**: Define service boundaries and data flow.  
3. **Create Diagrams**: Component, data flow, and sequence diagrams.  
4. **Estimate Workload**: Data volume, API requests per second.  
5. **Develop a Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Implement a basic energy tracking system.
